ðŸš€ DocPrompting: Enhancing Code Generation with Documentation

This project is a simplified implementation of the DocPrompting research paper, which improves code generation from natural language (NL) intent by retrieving and incorporating relevant documentation during prompting.

By leveraging retrieval-augmented prompting, the system ensures that generated code is more accurate, context-aware, and aligned with real-world documentation.

ðŸ§  Key Features

ðŸ”¹ Natural Language to Code â€“ Accepts NL intent from users at runtime.

ðŸ”¹ Documentation Retrieval â€“ Uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity to fetch the most relevant documentation snippets.

ðŸ”¹ LLM-powered Generation â€“ Generates Python code using a causal language model (CodeGen-350M-mono).

ðŸ”¹ Comparative Evaluation â€“ Compares outputs with vs. without documentation to measure improvement.

ðŸ”¹ Performance Metrics â€“ Evaluates code generation quality using CodeBLEU.
